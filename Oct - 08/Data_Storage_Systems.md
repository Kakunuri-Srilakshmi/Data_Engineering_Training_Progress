## **1. Database**

* **Concept:**
  A database is used to store and manage structured data for day-to-day operations. It allows **real-time updates**, retrieval, and modification of data.
* **Type:**
  **OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)** â€“ optimized for insert, update, and delete operations.
* **Characteristics:**

  * Handles structured data (tables, rows, columns)
  * Supports real-time read/write operations
  * Ensures data consistency and integrity
  * Used for transactional purposes
* **Examples:**

  * MySQL
  * PostgreSQL
  * Oracle Database



## **2. Data Warehouse**

* **Concept:**
  A Data Warehouse is used for **analytical processing**. It stores large volumes of historical data from multiple sources for **business intelligence (BI)** and **reporting**.
* **Type:**
  **OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)** â€“ optimized for complex queries and analysis.
* **Characteristics:**

  * Stores **structured** and historical data
  * Used for trend analysis and reporting
  * Data is cleaned, transformed, and optimized for queries
  * Slower writes but faster reads
* **Examples:**

  * Snowflake
  * Azure Synapse Analytics
  * Amazon Redshift



## **3. Data Lake**

* **Concept:**
  A Data Lake stores **raw and unprocessed data** from various sources, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured formats.
* **Type:**
  **Storage Repository**
* **Characteristics:**

  * Handles **structured, semi-structured, and unstructured** data
  * Stores data in its **native/raw format**
  * **Cost-effective** and **scalable** storage
  * Ideal for data scientists and machine learning
* **Examples:**

  * Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)
  * Amazon S3
  * Google Cloud Storage



## **4. Delta Lake**

* **Concept:**
  Delta Lake is a **storage layer** built on top of a Data Lake that adds **ACID transactions**, **data versioning**, and **schema enforcement**, ensuring reliability and consistency.
* **Type:**
  **Enhanced Data Lake**
* **Characteristics:**

  * Supports **ACID transactions**
  * Allows **time travel (versioning)**
  * Provides **schema evolution and enforcement**
  * Integrates easily with Apache Spark and Databricks
* **Examples:**

  * Databricks Delta Lake

| Concept            | Type               | Characteristics                       | Example            |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Database**       | OLTP               | Structured, real-time updates         | MySQL, PostgreSQL  |
| **Data Warehouse** | OLAP               | Analytical, structured, historical    | Snowflake, Synapse |
| **Data Lake**      | Storage Repository | Raw, semi/unstructured, cheap storage | ADLS, S3           |
| **Delta Lake**     | Enhanced Data Lake | ACID, transactions, versioning        | Databricks Delta   |
