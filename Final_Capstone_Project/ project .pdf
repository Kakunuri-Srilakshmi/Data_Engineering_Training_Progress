Capstone Project: Retail Inventory & Sales Performance
Tracker
Objective:
Build a data-driven system that monitors product inventory levels, analyzes sales
performance, and provides actionable retail insights — using MySQL, MongoDB, Python,
PySpark, Azure Databricks (executed in Google Colab), and Azure DevOps.
Task 1 – Database Foundations: MySQL & MongoDB
Tools: MySQL, MongoDB
Capstone Tasks:
Design MySQL tables for products , sales , and inventory .
Perform basic CRUD operations on products and sales data.
Write a stored procedure to identify low-stock items.
Store customer or supplier feedback (unstructured) in MongoDB.
Create a MongoDB index for quick search by product_id .
Deliverables:
SQL script with tables, CRUD operations, and stored procedure.
MongoDB script with sample feedback data and indexing.
Task 2 – Data Processing with Python
Tools: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Requests)
Capstone Tasks:
Load sales and inventory data from an API or CSV file.
Clean missing values and format date/time columns.
Use NumPy to calculate monthly sales and inventory turnover.
Generate reports on top-selling and underperforming products.
Deliverables:
Python script for data cleaning and sales analysis.
Processed dataset summarizing sales performance.
Task 3 – Retail Insights with PySpark
Tools: PySpark
Capstone Tasks:
Load sales and inventory datasets into PySpark DataFrames.
Join product, sales, and inventory data.
Group data by region or category to analyze sales trends.
Export aggregated results as CSV or Parquet files.
Deliverables:
PySpark script performing joins and aggregations.

Output file showing category-wise sales by region.
Task 4 – ETL Pipeline in Azure Databricks (Executed in Google Colab)
Tools: Google Colab (used for Azure Databricks simulation)
Capstone Tasks:
Load cleaned sales and inventory data into Colab notebook.
Simulate an ETL pipeline to update latest sales and stock data.
Save results as Delta-like or CSV outputs.
Run SQL-style queries in Colab to identify top 5 best-selling products.
Deliverables:
Google Colab notebook mimicking Databricks ETL steps.
Output data stored in CSV/Parquet format.
Task 5 – Project Automation and Tracking in Azure DevOps
Tools: Azure DevOps
Capstone Tasks:
Create a single Epic in Azure DevOps named “Retail Inventory & Sales
Performance Tracker.”
Students should then break it down later into Features, Tasks, and User Stories
inside the DevOps portal.
Capture and submit screenshots showing the Epic creation and initial setup.
Deliverables:
Screenshot of the Epic created in Azure DevOps.
Evidence of portal setup and naming consistency.
