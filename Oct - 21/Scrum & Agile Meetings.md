## **What is Scrum?**

**Scrum** is one of the most popular **frameworks used in Agile** methodology.

It helps teams **manage complex projects** by breaking them into **small, manageable tasks** called **sprints**.

A **sprint** is a short, fixed period (usually **1 to 4 weeks**) during which a specific piece of work is completed and made ready for review.

- Scrum focuses on **teamwork, accountability, and continuous improvement**.



## **Key Roles in Scrum**

1. **Product Owner** – Defines what needs to be built and sets priorities.
2. **Scrum Master** – Facilitates the process, removes obstacles, and ensures Scrum principles are followed.
3. **Development Team** – Builds and delivers the product during each sprint.


## **Example of Scrum in Action**

Imagine a team developing a **shopping app**.

* **Sprint 1:** Build the login and registration page.
* **Sprint 2:** Add product listing and search feature.
* **Sprint 3:** Add shopping cart and checkout process.

After each sprint, the team **reviews the product**, gets **feedback**, and **improves** in the next sprint.



# **Agile Meetings (Scrum Ceremonies)**

Agile, specifically Scrum, has **four main meetings** (also called **ceremonies**).

These help teams stay organized, collaborate effectively, and continuously improve.



## **1. Sprint Planning Meeting**

**Purpose:**
To decide what work will be done in the next sprint.

**Who attends:** Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team.

**Example:**
If the sprint goal is “Add payment feature,” the team discusses tasks like UI design, API integration, and testing.



## **2. Daily Stand-Up (Daily Scrum)**

**Purpose:**
A short **15-minute meeting** to discuss progress and obstacles.

**Each team member answers:**

* What did I do yesterday?
* What will I do today?
* Is there any blocker stopping me?

**Example:**
Developer says: “Yesterday I finished the login page. Today I’ll connect it with the backend. No blockers.”



## **3. Sprint Review**

**Purpose:**
To **demonstrate** what has been completed during the sprint.

**Who attends:** The entire team and stakeholders (like clients or managers).

**Example:**
The team shows the newly added “Add to Cart” feature and collects feedback for improvements.



## **4. Sprint Retrospective**

**Purpose:**
To **reflect** on the sprint and discuss **what went well**, **what didn’t**, and **how to improve** next time.

**Example:**

* What went well: Collaboration was strong.
* What didn’t: Testing took too long.
* Improvement: Start testing earlier in the sprint.



## **Summary Table**

| Meeting Name             | Purpose                     | Time                | Example                                        |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Sprint Planning**      | Plan sprint goals and tasks | At start of sprint  | Plan to build login feature                    |
| **Daily Stand-Up**       | Track daily progress        | Every day (15 mins) | “Yesterday I fixed a bug; today I’ll test it.” |
| **Sprint Review**        | Show completed work         | End of sprint       | Demo new payment feature                       |
| **Sprint Retrospective** | Improve team process        | End of sprint       | Discuss what to do better next time            |
